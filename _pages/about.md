My name is Elnara Mammadova. You can call me Elnara. (: I was born and grow up in Azerbaijan. What?!
​I heard your question. (: I know, sometimes it is hard to pronounce the name of my country from the first try. Let's practice. Use your four fingers and name them: (1)A/ˌɑː /- (2)zer /zɚ/- (3)bai /baɪˈ/- (4)djan /dʒɑːn/. Now, repeat each name and fold fingers once you pronounce it. Try to speed up the repetition. Here you go. You got it, Azerbaijan /ˌɑː.zɚ.baɪˈdʒɑːn/. (:
